        <h4>The Beginning <i class="far fa-sun"></i></h4>
        <p>Friend Finder was founded in the summer of 2017 by close friends and Dartmouth students, Jack and John. With most of their friends home for the break and conflicting work schedules, the two found themselves spending most of their free time alone. Days that should have been spent in the rare New Hampshire sunshine were wasted indoors. After many long and lonely weeks, the pair decided something needed to change and Friend Finder was born. </p>

        <h4>Finding a Team <i class="far fa-id-badge"></i></h4>
        <p>After spending a month hashing out the details, Jack and John were ready to build. The two were able to find six eager developers to help bring their idea to life. In the fall of 2017 the founding eight came together for the first time in a small coffee shop and the rest is history. Just shy of two years old, Friend Finder now employs over fifty people dedicated to creating and nurturing friendships.</p>

        <h4>Brainstorming <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i></h4>
        <p>From conception, Friend Finder has placed immense value in the ideas and perspectives our employees bring to the table. Weekly brainstorming sessions, monthly hobby allowances, and a laid back workplace culture are just some of the ways we foster creativity. Along the way weâ€™ve found that happiness greatly impacts performance. The happier our employees are, the better our product is.</p>

        <h4>Prototypes <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i></h4>
        <p>A large part of our development process lies in prototypes. Before our first version was made available to the market, Friend Finder went through 14 different iterations over the span of a year. Our current process involves holding large focus groups to test a potential feature. Through this we are able to gather authentic feedback that lets us know if our update is ready to launch or needs refinement back in the brainstorming phase.</p>

With over 4 million users, Friend Finder has helped create thousands of new and meaningful connections. Thanks to our dedicated team, people no longer have to watch opportunities and experiences pass them by.</p>
