                until into comes focus and that fact becomes realized.  Early school years and college is the place where you will forge some of 
                the more precious relationships with people that you may know for a lifetime.  It takes time to genuinely get to know people, their 
                interests and hobbies find a good fit that can be nurtured into something that can become a true friendship.  Unfortunately that 
                time seems to be hard to find.  So many factors come into play.  This is what friend finder is here for.  You can find friends for 
                all the occasions you wish to engage in.  Looking for a friend, group, or couple to enjoy activities with based shared interests.  
                Enjoy and find some new friends!!
